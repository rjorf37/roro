            My Dearest Momkey,<br><br>
            From the moment our eyes met, or to be more specific when MY eye saw you in grade 10th I knew there was something truly special about you. Every day since has only confirmed what my heart felt that first time: you are my dream come true (i js learned how to use colons :3).<br><br>
            Your smile lights up my world in ways I never imagined possible. Your laughter is the sweetest melody,(melody wela kuromi haha sowwy) and your kindness, a beacon of warmth that guides me through even the darkest days althought i did have one since i met yous tehee. I am endlessly grateful for the love and joy you bring into my life.<br><br>
            With every conversation, every shared moment, and every touch, I fall deeper in love with you. Your strength inspires me, your compassion moves me, and your beauty—both inside and out—takes my breath away.<br><br>
                       Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my greatest love. I am so lucky to have you by my side.<br><br>
